# 🧠 Learn Go — From Zero to Gopher 🐹

Welcome to my Golang learning journal! This repository tracks my progress as I learn the Go programming language, session by session - with notes, working `.go` files, and concept breakdowns.

---

## 🗂️ Structure

Each folder is a learning **session**. Every session contains:

- 📘 `notes.md` — Book-style conceptual breakdowns.
- 🧪 `.go` files — Practical code examples to test in VS Code.
- 🚀 Discoveries and edge cases as I hit them.

## 📌 Why I'm Learning Go

Golang is fast, simple, and powerful - ideal for backend systems, infrastructure tooling, and concurrent programming. I'm documenting every step to:

- Understand fundamentals in depth
- Keep track of syntax + idioms
- Build a habit of structured learning
- Help others starting their Go journey

## 🧭 Roadmap

| Session | Topics Covered                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| 01      | `package`, `main()`, I/O, maps, overflows, `byte` vs `rune`, `Scanln` vs `bufio` |
| 02      | *(Coming soon)*                      |
| ...     | *(More as I go!)*                    |

## 🛠️ How to Run

To run any session’s `.go` file:

```bash
go run filename.go
